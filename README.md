Calculator to help you play your merge games!

There are several merge games with the below mechanics:
- Merging 3 of the same item will give you 1 item of the next level.
- Merging 5 of the same item will give you 2 items of the next level.

This is a simple calculator that enables you to find out instantly how many of an item you *minimally* need to obtain a desired level of that chain.

### Example 1
8 x Level 1 = (5 + 3) x Level 1. They would merge to form (2 + 1) x Level 2 = 3 x Level 2.
3 x Level 2 would merge to form 1 x Level 3.

### Example 2
15 x Level 1 = (3\*5) x Level 1. They would merge to form (3\*2) x Level 2 = 6 x Level 2.
6 x Level 2 = (5 + 1) x Level 2. They would merge to form 2 x Level 3 + 1 x Level 2.
